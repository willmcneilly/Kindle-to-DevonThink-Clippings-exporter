Kindle-to-DevonThink-Clippings-exporter
=======================================


## About

A simple script that runs from the commandline, taking the 'My Clippings.txt' file from the Kindle and exports each as a separate DevonThink text note. If there is more than on note per book it will group them together in a folder with the a "#{book_name}, #{author_name}" structure.

## Limitations

This is quite rough and ready and suits my own needs perfectly, but plan to extend the functionality in future to allow
